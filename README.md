## Project Description
The Incidents of Chicago Crimes web map showcases crimes in Chicago, Illinois from 2010-2020 in two year intervals. By using this web map, users are able to identify areas in Chicago that have reported crimes as well as any patterns that has formed acrossed the city. Additionally, users are able to pick between four different basemaps that suits their preference. Furthermore, they have the option to view the data as heat maps. Moreover, users are able to compare crime incidents from year to year as well as view all crime incidents in Chicago combined together.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to bring awareness about crimes reported in Chicago as a high crime city. By visualizing the incidents of crimes throughout the years of 2010-2020 in two year intervals, we can identify the proportion of crimes in the city as well as any patterns that form in specific parts of the city. Lastly, we can compare crimes reported between years to discover if the incidents of crime have gone down or increased throughout the years.
